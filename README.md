# Serverless Indexer

This is a set of Lambda functions written in the [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework that are triggered by webhooks on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

Here are the current Ghost events / webhooks, and their endpoints:

| Ghost Event | Endpoint |
| ---- | ---- |
| Post published | .../*stage*/add-index |
| Post unpublished | .../*stage*/delete-index |
| Post deleted | .../*stage*/deleted-index |
| Published post updated | .../*stage*/update-index |

The Lambda function on each endpoint receives the blog post from the Ghost webhook and updates the correct [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) index based on the origin of the Ghost webhook.

Here are the currently configured origins and Algolia indices:

| Ghost Origin | Algolia index |
| ---- | ---- |
| http://localhost:2368 | dev-news |
| https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ | news |
| https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/ | news-es |
| https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/ | news-zh |
| https://www.freecodecamp.org/portuguese/news/ | news-pt |

**Prerequisites**: 

- AWS CLI and an AWS account with access to Secrets Manager
- An [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) account access to the pre-configured indices above (see table)
