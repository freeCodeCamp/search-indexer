# Serverless Indexer

This is a set of Lambda functions written in the [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework that are triggered by webhooks on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

Here are the current Ghost events / webhooks, and their endpoints:

| Ghost Event            | Endpoint                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Post published         | .../_stage_/add-index     |
| Post unpublished       | .../_stage_/delete-index  |
| Post deleted           | .../_stage_/deleted-index |
| Published post updated | .../_stage_/update-index  |

The Lambda function on each endpoint receives the blog post from the Ghost webhook and updates the correct [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) index based on the origin of the Ghost webhook.

Here are the currently configured origins and Algolia indices:

| Ghost Origin                                  | Algolia index |

**Prerequisites**:

- AWS CLI and an AWS account with access to Secrets Manager
- An [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) account access to the pre-configured indices above (see table)

## How to prepare your local machine

1. Create an Algolia account with access to the freeCodeCamp News indices
1. Go to LastPass, search for the shared `[keys] [AWS] [Lambda] - News Indexer` note, and add the `[news-indexer-lambda]` credentials to `~/.aws/credentials`
1. Clone this repo and install the necessary packages with `npm ci`
1. Copy `sample.env.yml` to a new file named `.env.yml`
1. In `.env.yml` set `AWS_PROFILE` to `'news-indexer-lambda'`
1. Start developing

## How to develop and test locally

1. Make your changes and run `npm start`
1. Open your local Ghost Integrations dashboard at http://localhost:2368/ghost/#/settings/integrations
1. Click "Add custom integration" to create a new custom integration
1. Check the console output and add the Lambda function URLs (ex: https://localhost:3000/dev/add-index) to the correct Ghost events. Check the Ghost events and endpoints table near the top of this document for more information
1. Publish, update, and delete articles on Ghost locally. You can view your changes on Algolia on the `dev` application in the `news-dev` index
1. If you make changes while the server is running, kill the server with Ctrl / Cmd + C. Then restart the server with `npm start` to test your changes

## How to deploy changes

1. After a PR with changes is accepted and merged, deploy changes with `npm run deploy-dev` or `npm run deploy`

## How to change Algolia API keys on AWS

### Generate a new key on Algolia

1. Sign into Algolia with the dev@freecodecamp.org account
1. Select the `dev` or `Production` application from the dropdown at the top of the page
1. Click "API Keys", then click the "All API Keys" tab near the top of the screen
1. Click the "New API Key" button, and generate a new key with the following ACLs (action control lists): `search`, `addObject`, `deleteObject`, `browse`, `listIndexes`, `deleteIndex`
1. Click the "Create" button
1. Copy the new Algolia API key

### Update the Algolia key entry in AWS Secrets Manager

1. Create an [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) account under the freeCodeCamp AWS team with access to [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
1. Sign in and go to https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/
1. Click "serverless-indexer"
1. Click "Retrieve secret value" and click the "Edit" button
1. Paste the new Algolia API key in as the value of `ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY` in either the `dev` or `prod` object
1. Click the "Save" button

## How to remove a service

**WARNING**: Removing a `dev` or `prod` service is only necessary in a few cases, such as migrating to a new region.

By removing a service, the base URL for the Lambda functions will be lost. This means that all the webhooks in each Ghost instance will need to be updated once the service is redeployed.

To deploy updates, it's not necessary to remove a service first. Just follow the deployment instructions [here](#how-to-deploy-changes).

Use the following commands with caution:

1. Install Serverless globally with `npm install -g serverless`
1. Run `serverless remove --stage [dev / prod] --region us-east-2`
